# 🚨 Performance Concerns - Quick Summary

## Your Question
> "The Raspberry Pi is handling: webapp server, FTP server for SEC110, PBT input→pulses, and TiM240 processing. Red flags?"

## Short Answer
**YES - Multiple red flags! 🚩** But it's manageable with the right Pi and optimizations.

---

## 🚩 Main Concerns

### 1. **CPU Overload** 🔥
All those services can max out CPU, especially during:
- Multiple web clients accessing dashboard
- FTP file transfer happening
- PBT event detection
- TiM240 processing

**Risk:** Dropped samples, laggy web interface, system freeze

---

### 2. **Real-Time Processing** ⏱️
PBT requires 800 Hz sampling (1.25ms per sample)
- If any process blocks for >1.25ms → **dropped samples**
- Python + Linux are NOT real-time systems
- Other services can interrupt PBT processing

**Risk:** Missing important sensor events

---

### 3. **I/O Bottlenecks** 📉
Multiple serial ports + network + disk I/O:
- USB bandwidth limits
- Serial buffer overflows
- Network congestion

**Risk:** Data corruption, communication errors

---

### 4. **Single Point of Failure** 💔
If any service crashes → whole system affected
- No isolation between sensors
- All sensors go offline together
- Difficult to debug

**Risk:** Poor reliability for demo day

---

## ✅ Solutions

### 🎯 **Quick Fixes (Do These First!)**

#### 1. Use Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB+ RAM
```
Pi 3 or less:  ❌ Will struggle
Pi 4 2GB:      ⚠️  Marginal
Pi 4 4GB+:     ✅ Should work with optimization
Pi 5:          ✅ Even better
```

#### 2. Optimize Startup
```bash
# Use the optimized startup script
sudo ./start_optimized.sh

# This sets:
# - High priority for PBT (real-time critical)
# - CPU pinning (PBT on dedicated core)
# - Lower priority for FTP
```

#### 3. Use Optimized Config
```bash
# Copy optimized settings
cp config_optimized.py config.py

# Key changes:
# - Reduced update rate (10 Hz instead of 20 Hz)
# - Smaller buffers (less memory)
# - Client limits
```

#### 4. Monitor Performance
```bash
# Check if system can handle load
./monitor_performance.sh

# Look for:
# - CPU < 80%
# - Temperature < 70°C
# - No throttling warnings
```

### 🏆 **Better Solution (Recommended)**

#### **Move FTP to Separate Device**
```
Raspberry Pi:
├─ PBT sensor
├─ PMT sensor  
├─ GM counter
├─ TiM240 processing
└─ Web dashboard

Laptop/PC:
└─ FTP server for SEC110
```

**Why:** FTP is least time-critical, easy to offload

**Benefit:** ~15% CPU freed up

---

### 🚀 **Best Solution (If Budget Allows)**

#### **Two Raspberry Pis - Distributed Architecture**
```
Pi #1 "Sensor Hub":
├─ PBT processing (dedicated, real-time)
├─ PMT processing
├─ GM counter
└─ TiM240 processing

Pi #2 "Web Server":
├─ Flask web app
├─ WebSocket streaming
├─ FTP server
└─ Data visualization
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Sensors never affected by web traffic
- ✅ If web server crashes, sensors keep running
- ✅ Better reliability
- ✅ Can scale web servers

**Cost:** ~$35-75 for second Pi

## 📊 Performance Estimates

### **Your Current Setup:**

| Scenario | CPU Load | Will It Work? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **1-2 web clients** | 40-60% | ✅ Yes |
| **10+ students on demo day** | 80-100% | ⚠️ Laggy, possible drops |
| **20+ clients + FTP transfer** | 100%+ | ❌ System freeze likely |

### **With Optimizations:**

| Scenario | CPU Load | Will It Work? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **1-2 web clients** | 30-40% | ✅ Great |
| **10+ students** | 60-80% | ✅ OK (some lag) |
| **20+ clients** | 90-100% | ⚠️ Still risky |

## 🎯 Recommendations

### **Minimum (Must Do!):**
1. ✅ Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB+ RAM
2. ✅ Use `./start_optimized.sh` for proper priorities
3. ✅ Copy `config_optimized.py` to `config.py`
4. ✅ Add heatsink + fan (cooling!)
5. ✅ Test under load BEFORE demo day

### **Recommended (Better):**
6. ✅ Move FTP to laptop/PC
7. ✅ Run `./monitor_performance.sh` regularly
8. ✅ Set up watchdog service
9. ✅ Separate Flask instances per sensor

### **Ideal (Best):**
10. ✅ Use two Raspberry Pis (distributed)
11. ✅ Offload pulse generation to Arduino
12. ✅ Implement proper monitoring/logging

---

## 🧪 Before Demo Day Checklist

### **Performance Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Check system capability
./monitor_performance.sh

# 2. Load test with multiple clients
# Have 10+ people access the web app simultaneously

# 3. Monitor during stress
watch -n 1 'top -b -n 1 | head -20'

# 4. Check for dropped samples in logs
tail -f logs/pbt.log | grep -i "drop\|miss\|error"

# 5. Temperature monitoring
watch -n 5 'cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp | awk "{print \$1/1000 \"°C\"}"'
```

### **Warning Signs:**
❌ CPU consistently >80%  
❌ Temperature >70°C  
❌ Web interface becomes unresponsive  
❌ Samples being dropped  
❌ "Throttling" warnings in logs

## 💡 Decision Matrix

### **Choose Single Pi If:**
- ✅ Budget constrained
- ✅ Have Pi 4 4GB+
- ✅ <10 simultaneous web users expected
- ✅ Can accept some performance degradation

### **Choose Two Pis If:**
- ✅ Need maximum reliability
- ✅ >15 simultaneous users expected
- ✅ Can afford ~$50 extra
- ✅ Production/permanent deployment

## 🎓 For Your Capstone

### **Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Development (Now)**
```bash
# Test on single Pi with optimizations
./start_optimized.sh
```

**Phase 2: Testing (2 weeks before)**
```bash
# Load test with classmates
# Monitor performance
# Identify bottlenecks
```

**Phase 3: Demo Prep (1 week before)**
```bash
# If performance issues found:
# Option A: Apply more optimizations
# Option B: Add second Pi for web server
# Option C: Limit concurrent users
```

**Phase 4: Demo Day**
```bash
# Have backup plan ready!
# Monitor system during demo
# Keep laptop as FTP server backup
```

---

## 📈 Quick Optimizations

### **If CPU Too High:**
```python
# In config.py
EMIT_INTERVAL = 0.2      # 5 Hz (was 10 Hz)
BUFFER_SIZE = 1000       # Smaller buffer
MAX_CLIENTS = 5          # Limit users
```

### **If Memory Issues:**
```python
# In config.py
BUFFER_SIZE = 1000       # Reduce buffer
MAX_DISPLAY_POINTS = 1000
```

### **If Missing Samples:**
```bash
# Increase PBT priority
sudo nice -n -15 python3 app.py

# Pin to dedicated core  
taskset -c 0 python3 app.py
```

---

## 🆘 Emergency Backup Plan

### **If System Can't Handle Load on Demo Day:**

**Plan A:** Limit concurrent users
```
"Please access one at a time"
Or take turns in groups of 5
```

**Plan B:** Use test_mode.py
```bash
# Run without real sensor (simulated data)
python3 test_mode.py
# No hardware = no real-time constraints
```

**Plan C:** Video recording
```
Record demo video beforehand
Show video if live demo fails
```

**Should you risk it for capstone?**
- **For development/testing:** YES - learn what works ✅
- **For final demo:** MAYBE - have backup plan ready ⚠️
- **For production/permanent:** NO - use distributed architecture ❌

**Biggest risk:** System freeze during demo with 20+ students trying to access it! 🔥

**Best mitigation:** Test with 10+ people 2 weeks before demo!

**Your plan is ambitious but achievable with proper optimization and testing!** 🎯

**Key takeaway: Test under load EARLY, don't wait until demo day!** ⚡
